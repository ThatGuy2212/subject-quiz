class Quiz:
    """ Authors: Gray, Harper, Garner, Robins; Date: 2 December 2012
    Purpose: This class manages a (text only) multi-choice quiz. It will be extended in future versions with a
    graphical user interface, and access to files of multiple questions and answers. This class is supported by the
    class Question. Instances of Question represent the individual questions (and answers of the quiz). In this
    version of the program there are only two questions. """
